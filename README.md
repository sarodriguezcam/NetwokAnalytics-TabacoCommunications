# NetwokAnalytics-TabacoComunications

This is the Gephi network of the communications of the Tabaco Control Agencies of the US.

It contains 3 workspaces: 

-One with the resulting network, colorized and measures of Betweenness Centrality and Density.

-An other one with the same network but using a layout that organizes the nodes based on size (in this case, based on betweenness centrality) in a circular distribution.

-And a last one, where the nodes have been grouped by agency (size based on betweenness centrality still applies).



Measures of intra and interagency density where added to the data laboratory of the grouped network as new attributes (rows).

In order to visualize the correct network, make sure that all of the visualizations have the filter of "collaborations" in rage 2 to 4 applied. This filter can be activaded in the filter panel at the right side of the screen.
